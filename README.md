# Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge Implementations

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal implementations of algorithms and protocols from the book *Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge* by Justin Thaler. As part of my journey to deepen my understanding of the subject, I have started to put theory into practice by coding these concepts. This work is intended as a study aid and a practical exploration of the book's material.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the implementations in this repository were created as part of a learning process and may contain mistakes. They are provided for educational purposes only and **should not be used in production environments or in any high-stakes context**. While I strive for accuracy and reliability, the complex nature of cryptographic algorithms and protocols means that unintended errors are possible. Users are encouraged to thoroughly review and test the code before considering it for any practical applications.
